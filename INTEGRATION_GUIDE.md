# 🎵 MoodTune AI - Complete Integration Guide

## ✅ **Integration Complete!**

Your FastAPI backend is now fully connected to the Next.js frontend with real audio emotion recognition.

## 🚀 **How to Run the Complete System**

### 1. Start the Backend (Terminal 1)
```bash
cd "d:/SCIENCE/DJS AIML/SEM 3/HackProj/moodtune-ai"
python -c "import uvicorn; uvicorn.run('api:app', host='0.0.0.0', port=8000, reload=True)"
```

### 2. Start the Frontend (Terminal 2)
```bash
cd "d:/SCIENCE/DJS AIML/SEM 3/HackProj/moodtune-ai"
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 **New Features Added**

### 🎤 **Real Voice Analysis**
- Voice recordings now send actual audio data to FastAPI backend
- Uses Wav2Vec2 model for emotion recognition
- Maps detected emotions to mood parameters

### 📁 **File Upload Support**
- New "Upload" tab in the input selector
- Drag & drop or click to select audio files
- Supports WAV, MP3, M4A, OGG formats
- Real-time processing with visual feedback

### 🔗 **Backend Integration**
- FastAPI backend with CORS enabled
- Emotion mapping system
- Fallback to text analysis if backend fails
- Proper error handling and loading states

## 🎨 **User Interface Updates**

### Three Input Modes:
1. **🎤 Voice** - Record audio directly in browser
2. **💬 Text** - Type your mood description
3. **📁 Upload** - Upload audio files from your system

### Enhanced UX:
- Smooth tab transitions with animated slider
- File upload with drag & drop support
- Processing states and loading indicators
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks

## 🤖 **Emotion Recognition**

### Supported Emotions:
- **Happy** → Euphoric mood (high energy, high valence)
- **Sad** → Melancholic mood (low energy, low valence)
- **Angry** → Angry mood (high energy, low valence)
- **Fear** → Anxious mood (high energy, low valence)
- **Surprise** → Excited mood (high energy, high valence)
- **Disgust** → Frustrated mood (medium energy, low valence)
- **Neutral** → Contemplative mood (balanced parameters)

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### Frontend (Next.js):
- `/api/analyze/route.ts` - Handles both text and audio analysis
- `FileUpload.tsx` - New drag & drop file upload component
- `MoodTuneApp.tsx` - Updated with three input modes
- Real audio data processing with base64 encoding

### Backend (FastAPI):
- `api.py` - Wav2Vec2 emotion recognition
- CORS middleware for frontend integration
- Emotion to mood parameter mapping
- Error handling and model validation

## 🧪 **Testing the Integration**

### Test Voice Recording:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Complete onboarding
3. Select "Voice" tab
4. Record your voice saying something emotional
5. Watch as it analyzes your actual voice emotion

### Test File Upload:
1. Select "Upload" tab
2. Drag & drop an audio file or click to browse
3. Select a WAV/MP3 file with speech
4. Watch real emotion analysis in action

### Test Text Input:
1. Select "Text" tab
2. Type your mood description
3. Uses keyword-based analysis as fallback

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### Backend Issues:
- Ensure Python dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check if port 8000 is available
- Verify model downloads (requires internet for first run)

### Frontend Issues:
- Ensure Next.js is running on port 3000
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify file upload formats are supported

### Integration Issues:
- Both servers must be running simultaneously
- Check network connectivity between frontend and backend
- Verify API endpoints are accessible

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

✅ **Backend Running**: http://localhost:8000 shows welcome message  
✅ **Frontend Running**: http://localhost:3000 loads the app  
✅ **Voice Analysis**: Records and analyzes real audio emotions  
✅ **File Upload**: Processes uploaded audio files  
✅ **Playlist Generation**: Creates music based on detected mood
